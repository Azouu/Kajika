# Kajika
Kajika is an open source web application that can be used to visualize networks and charts. 

## Getting started
  ### Prerequisites
Kajika currently has the following dependencies :
* MongoDB 4.0
* MongoDB Compass
* XAMPP 7.3.6 (Compatibility with Windows, Linux and Mac OS)

 ### Installation 
 
 #### 1. Install MongoDB 4.0 and MongoDB Compass
 Go to https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community .  
 Choose the 4.0 version and the MSI package, along with the OS that you use.
 Download the file and execute it. Select the checkbox "Install MongoDB Compass" when you are asked to.
 
 * **For Windows users :**  
 Navigate to the C Drive on your computer and create a new folder called data here.  
 Inside the data folder you just created, create another folder called db.
  ```
  md C:\data\db
  ```
  When you have done that, navigate to your MongoDB installation folder, then go to the bin folder and lauch mongod.exe.
  If you have kept the default MongoDB path during the installation, you can execute this command in the command prompt :
  ```
  C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe
  ```
  __Note : You can save this command in a .cmd file to launch MongoDB faster.__  
  
 * **For Linux users :**  
 Go to https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/administration/install-on-linux/ and choose one of the distributions.
